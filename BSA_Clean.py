This matches our expectations, namely:
- the times when saccharin and water were given.
- the start of the saccharin drinking session and the time of LiCl/saline injection.
- count the number of neurons recorded.
- print one neuronâ€™s data to understand its format.

Now, we'll extract the spike data
