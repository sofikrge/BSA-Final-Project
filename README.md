â””â”€â”€ functions          <- Contains all of our helper functions we call in our main file
    â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py    <- Init file for inheritance
    â”œâ”€â”€ analyze_firing_rates.py     <- Processe and analyze firing rates across different datasets
    â”œâ”€â”€ apply_manual_fusion.py      <- Applies manual neuron modifications (fusion and deletion) based on explicitly assigned neuron indices in the main file
    â”œâ”€â”€ correlogram.py              <- Calculates the correlogram employing a difference-based approach
    â”œâ”€â”€ cv_fano.py                  <- Calculates and plots the CV and FF metrics
    â”œâ”€â”€ isi_tih.py                  <- Calculates the ISIs and plots their distribution in a TIH, if filtering is enabled it also filters out biologically impossible spikes

    â”œâ”€â”€ plot_correlogram_matrix.py  <- Plots all correlograms for a dataset in a single matrix and aligns them according to their neuron number

    â”œâ”€â”€ psth_rasterplot.py          <- Generates and saves a single figure showing both pre-CTA and post-CTA raster plots and PSTH overlays side by side, mooving-average smoothing
    â”œâ”€â”€ psth_twobytwo.py            <- Creates 2x2 raster-style histogram plots per neuron + creates a group-level summary, has baseline-correction and mooving-average smoothing
